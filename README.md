🚀 Thrilled to Share Our Robotics Journey! 🤖🎯

We, Team Phoenix, recently participated in the IESL RoboGames 2024 university category, where we tackled a robotics simulation challenge using Webots and the E-puck robot 🤖. It was an incredible experience that pushed our coding, problem-solving, and simulation skills to the next level!

🔹 Our Mission: Develop an arena simulation and program the E-puck robot to navigate a grid, identifying colored walls in a predefined sequence.

🔹 Tech Stack: Python for coding, Webots for simulation.

🔹 Key Skills Gained:

✅ Robotics Simulation & AI-based path planning 🛤️

✅ Python Programming for autonomous navigation 🧭

✅ Team Collaboration in problem-solving and debugging 🛠️

✅ Algorithm Development for real-time decision-making 🧠

Our journey was full of challenges, from designing an efficient navigation algorithm to ensuring precise color detection and movement. Through dedication, innovation, and teamwork, we successfully completed the competition tasks!
